This is a comic book infused with web animations!  
Why would I choose websites, as opposed to an ePub/PDF Book or a print-out zine, as the medium?

First of all, the internet is an open place. Nothing excites me more than HTML/CSS/Javascript, because anyone who has an internet connection can access the information delivered by them. I want my comics to live in such a place. 

Second, I want to bring searchable text to webcomics. Comics are a combination of pictures and text. However, the text is exported as imagery data. The text information - narrations, dialogs, onomatopoeia - is not accessible or searchable by screen readers or search engines.

Last but not the least, responsive web design can make comics adaptable for varying screen sizes. I want to honor the readers’ choice of reading device. Whether they choose to view the content on their small mobile device, or on their large desktop screen, I don’t want the format of the images hindering the message. 

You can view the live comic... once I finish publishing it.

For now, this project is under development. You can view it from your local machine:
