                Thanks for checking out on my unfinished book. <br />
                Chapter 1 is done. Chapter 2 through Chapter 5 are still a work-in-progress. <br />
                The game design in Chapter 2 is taking up so much time but it is almost done and is certainly worth all the sweat!! <br />
